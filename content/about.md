Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the web, where I share my various creative
output.


### About me

* Initial release: `(time_t)266699460`
* Sex: neutrois
* Gender: nonbinary gal
* Pronouns: she/her or they/them
* Favorite colors: purple, red, sometimes blue
* Favorite pattern: buffalo plaid
* Furry: Yeah kind of?

Career-wise I'm a software engineer at a [publishing concern](https://maven.io/), but I also like to draw, make music, and make and play video games. Someday I'll figure out how to find the right balance between all those things.

In my professional life I've worked on a lot of the software that lives behind the scenes of products and websites you've probably used. So that's pretty cool, I guess. These days I'm trying to focus more on things that improve overall quality of life, particularly around my own accessibility issues due to [fibromyalgia](/blog/?tag=fibromyalgia).

### About this site

Because I do so many different things and all of them need to be presented in
different ways, I ended up writing my own content management system,
[Publ](http://publ.beesbuzz.biz). I like to think it does things differently
enough from other CMSes to make it worthwhile, both from a flexibility and a
performance/scalability standpoint. It is [open source](https://github.com
/PlaidWeb/Publ).

I have also provided [my site templates](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz) as a reference; if you notice any issues with this website that could be addressed there, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz/issues).

### Contact options

If you would like to get in touch with me, here's some choices:

* Email: `fluffy[at]beesbuzz[dot]biz`
* Real-time chat: [Discord](/discord)
* Social media: [Mastodon](/mastodon), [Twitter](/twitter), and [Tumblr](/tumblr)
