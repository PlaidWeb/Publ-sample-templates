Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the web, where I share my various creative
output.

I can't seem to work on the same sort of thing for very long at a time, and so I
love to keep on learning how to do new things.  Some of it is decent, some of it
is bad, and some of it's pretty okay, but all of it is mine in some way.

Because I do so many different things and all of them need to be presented in
different ways, I ended up writing my own content management system,
[Publ](http://publ.beesbuzz.biz). I like to think it does things differently
enough from other CMSes to make it worthwhile, both from a flexibility and a
performance/scalability standpoint. It is [open source](https://github.com
/fluffy-critter/Publ).

### About me

I'm just some random person in Seattle, who lives with an integer number of cats.

I used to work in the software industry for companies you have probably heard
of, and it's very likely you've used software I worked on without even knowing
it. For now I'm just doing my own thing and living off my savings and the
[kindness of strangers](/patreon).

If you would like to hire me to do something, please get in touch and we can try
to work something out. My terms are pretty flexible!

### Contact options

If you would like to get in touch with me, here's some choices:

* Email: `fluffy[at]beesbuzz[dot]biz`
* Real-time chat: [Discord](/discord)
* Social media: [Mastodon](/mastodon), [Twitter](/twitter), and [Tumblr](/tumblr)

Or I guess you can post a comment below, since I forgot to disable comments here. Oops.
