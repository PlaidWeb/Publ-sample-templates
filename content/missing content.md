Oops, looks like you followed a link to some content which is no longer here. Sorry about that! I completely redid my website and I didn't migrate all the old blog content over, since there was *quite a lot* to deal with and most of it didn't seem particularly valuable.

However, if you're seeing this page it means you were probably looking for something that actually was valuable! Fortunately, I am keeping logs of which pages are still getting a lot of traffic and since I still have all the old content archived I will probably end up restoring things that are helpful to people or particularly notable.

If there's something in particular you were looking for and really want back, you could try posting a comment! Or, if you still have the URL of the original content, try [the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org), which likely still has it.
