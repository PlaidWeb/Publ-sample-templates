short version is that you may redistribute, remix, and adapt my content (even for commercial works!) as long as you

There is no need to get prior approval; however, if you do use my stuff in

### Privacy Policy

This site does not collect any information on its visitors beyond the usual
things that all websites get (namely your IP address and time of visit and maybe
the link you followed to get here).

If you post comments, I will see them, as will everyone else. I will also be able to see your IP address, and whatever email address or website you associate with the comment. Your email address will only be used for providing the user icon via [Libravatar](https://libravatar.org) and sending reply notifications, if requested. [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) will also set a client-side cookie to automatically fill in future comment forms; this is not associated with any server-side tracking mechanism.

If you sign in using a third-party identity (email address, social login, etc.)
I will see that too, but that's entirely the point to signing in to begin with.
If you don't want me to see that, don't sign in, I guess?
Anyway this site also uses a cookie to track you having
logged in. The cookie itself is only used to identify you for the duration of
your session.
