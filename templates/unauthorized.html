                <p>I check the logs fairly frequently to grant access to new users, but you can get in touch with me to request access in case I missed something or if the <a href="{{category.link(template='profile')}}">identity you used</a> isn't one I'm likely to recognize (e.g. you logged in using email but I only know you on Twitter, or we've never interacted before).</p>
